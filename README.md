# Codebreakers
CodeBreakers is a game where the user must guess the generated random 4 digit code within 8 guesses.

All digits are unique and you will be told how many digits you guessed correctly after each guess.

The tricky part is: the game doesnt tell you which numbers are in the right position, just the number of correct guess that are in the wrong position.

If you want to give it a shot clone this repo, compile and run the generated executable file.

GoodLuck!
